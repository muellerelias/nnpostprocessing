# Using weather regime information in post-processing of country-aggregated medium-range weather forecasts


This is the git-repo to my master thesis with the topic: "Using weather regime information in post-processing of country-aggregated medium-range weather forecast"

## Dataset
The following data were used:
- sub-seasonal to seasonal ensemble dataset from ECMWF. which are country-aggregated
- Atlantic-European weather regime projection's, calculated with dhe sub-seasonal to seasonal dateset


## Requirements

- python 3
- pip3

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install tensorflow properscoring matplotlib pandas keras-tuner
```

## Usage
- To convert a data set consisting of CSV files into a Numpy Array, which is used in training. Please modify and execute the script [build_np_array](../blob/master/build_np_array). 
- The directory [differentModels](../blob/master/differentModels) contains 10 different Python files for training the 10 models shown in Subsection 4.3 of my master thesis.
